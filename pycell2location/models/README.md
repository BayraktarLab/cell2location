### The models are defined as python classes with the following inheritance structure to allow methods to be reused:

\- BaseModel - methods needed for Pymc3, Pyro and other implementations

-- Pymc3Model - methods for any Pymc3 model    
--- Pymc3LocModel - methods for location models (fixed gene loadings, mapping to locations)   
---- LocationModelV7_V4_V4 - definition of one specific cell location model model    


```python
