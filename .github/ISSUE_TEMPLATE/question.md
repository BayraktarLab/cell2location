### Problem

<!-- Please describe your problem below: -->
...

- [ ] I follow the instructions from the [cell2location tutorial (using on scvi-tools)](https://cell2location.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/cell2location_tutorial.html).
- [ ] I have adjusted required hyperparameters to my dataset and tissue `N_cells_per_location` and `detection_alpha`.
- [ ] I have provided 10X reaction/inlet as `batch_key` for reference NB regression.
- [ ] I have checked [scverse Discourse](https://discourse.scverse.org/c/ecosytem/cell2location/) and [old Cell2location Community Forum](https://github.com/BayraktarLab/cell2location/discussions), and did not find a solution.
